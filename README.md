# -A-B-Testing-Approach-for-Comparing-Performance-of-ML-Models
The objective of this project is to compare the performance of BERT and DistilBERT models for building an efficient Question and Answering system. Using A/B testing approach, we explore the effectiveness and efficiency of both models and determine which one is better suited for Q&amp;A tasks.
